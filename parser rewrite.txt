It's time to rewrite code incorporating past lessons.
Idea is parser object with inheritance for parse10k,q,8k,s-1, etc


recursiveparser = parser.recursiveparse()

class recursiveparse10k:
inherit recursiveparser

add partparser
add itemparser
add base_elems (what elems count as just under root)


hmmm

class parser
add (recursive, relative, cleanup)
