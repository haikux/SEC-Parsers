Layout
1. Recursive parse (find suspected headers, etc quickly) (usually under .2s)
2. get top level elements (e.g. we've narrowed down the possible elements, now we apply slower get all text method to find top level))
3. Relative parse, that uses 1 root.iter method.
4. clean_parse that assigns clean parsing types
