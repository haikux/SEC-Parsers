            StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements, within
            the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933 that
            involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements convey our current
            expectations or forecasts of future events. All statements contained in this Annual
            Report other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements.
            Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our future financial position,
            business strategy, budgets, projected costs, plans and objectives of management for
            future operations. The words “may,” “continue,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “will,”
            “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “seek,” “anticipate,” “should,” “could,” “would,”
            “potential,” or the negative of those terms and similar expressions may identify
            forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean
            that a statement is not forward-looking. You should not place undue reliance on these
            forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. All of these
            forward-looking statements are based on information available to us at this time, and we
            assume no obligation to update any of these statements. Actual results could differ from
            those projected in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors,
            including those identified in “Business,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
            Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and elsewhere. We urge you to review and
            consider the various disclosures made by us in this report, and those detailed from time
            to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, that attempt to
            advise you of the risks and factors that may affect our future results. Factors that
            could cause actual results to differ materially include, among others, our ability to
            make good decisions about the deployment of capital, our substantial capital
            requirements and absence of liquidity, competition, our inability to obtain maximum
            value for our holdings, our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, our
            ability to execute our strategy, market valuations in sectors in which we operate, our
            need to manage our assets, and risks associated with our assets and their performance,
            including the fact that most have a limited history and a history of operating losses,
            face intense competition and may never be profitable, the effect of economic conditions
            in the business sectors in which our partner companies operate, compliance with
            government regulation and legal liabilities.” Many of these factors are beyond our
            ability to predict or control. In addition, as a result of these and other factors, our
            past financial performance should not be relied on as an indication of future
            performance. All forward-looking statements attributable to us, or to persons acting on
            our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. We
            undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements,
            whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required
            by law. In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking events and
            circumstances discussed in this report might not occur.JOBS ActWe qualify as an
            “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act
            of 2012 (the JOBS Act). As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain
            reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to
            public companies. Pursuant to these provisions:     ·we are not required to comply with
            the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
            (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act);    ·we have (i) reduced disclosure obligations regarding
            executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (ii) exemptions
            from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation,
            including golden parachute compensation.We may take advantage of these provisions for up
            to five years or until such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth
            company.We would cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest to occur of
            (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual
            revenue; (2) the date we qualify as a “large accelerated filer,” with at least
            $700 million of public float (3) the issuance, in any three-year period, by us of more
            than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities held by non-affiliates; and (4) the
            last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of our initial public
            offering.In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth
            company can use the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the
            Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act ”), for complying with new or
            revised accounting standards. This permits an emerging growth company to delay the
            adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to
            private companies. We intend to take advantage of the exemptions discussed above.
            Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than the information you
            receive from other public companies.TABLE OF CONTENTSPART I4   Item 1.Business4   Item

                    parsing_type="strong;emphasis;emphasis capitalization;">1606 Corp., a Nevada
                    corporation (the “Company ,” “we ,” or “us ”) was incorporated in Nevada in
                    February 2021 as a spin-off from Singlepoint Inc. in April 2021. We started by
                    offering a tobacco- and nicotine-free smoking alternative called “1606 Original
                    Hemp.” We started to sell hemp, aroma-free cigarettes, first by reselling the
                    star brand, and eventually our own brand called “TRUZ.” The brands expanded to
                    include “Singlez,” an individually packeted version of the TRUZ hemp cigarettes.
                    This business has been discontinued.In August of 2023, we decided to use our
                    knowledge of the cannabidiol (“CBD ”) industry to move into AI chatbots
                    specifically made for the CBD industry. We partnered with ARXT Labs to create a
                    proprietary Chatbot using AI to answer customer questions and recommend a
                    product based on their answers and preferences. We then signed a distribution
                    contract with Cool Blue Distribution to sell the service to CBD companies as
                    well as offer their CBD expertise through Cool Blue’s owner, Don Flanagan. In
                    late 2023, we debuted our first chat bot, “chatCBDW by CBDW AI,” and began
                    signing up customers to test and implement the bot on their CBD websites.  With
                    our corporate headquarters located in Phoenix, Arizona, our executive team
                    experienced in CBD products, and our board’s knowledge of the technology and AI
                    spaces, we believe we are positioned to become the market leader for AI Bot
                    technology.We also see the future potential for our chatbot technology to expand
                    beyond the CBD industry to any industry with issues with consumer questions and
                    indecisive over product choices. This includes the solar, beauty, and auto parts
                    industries among many others.</company_designated_header>
                <company_designated_header title="Distribution"
                    parsing_type="strong;emphasis;emphasis capitalization;">We are focused on
                    signing business to use our chatbot with a monthly recuring licensing fee model.
                    Through a combination of our website, online ads, and email campaigns targeted
                    towards CBD brands and retailers, we have cultivated considerable interest in
                    our company and our AI chatbot technology.  We are also using independent sales
                    organizations (“ISOs ”) to sell the chatbot or include it in a package deal with
                    their products. These ISOs include but are not limited to CBD distributors,
                    website designers and builders, and payment processing services within and
                    outside the CBD industry.</company_designated_header>
                <company_designated_header title="Our Strategy"
                    parsing_type="strong;emphasis;emphasis capitalization;">The global artificial
                    intelligence market has seen remarkable growth, valued at $428 billion in 2022
                    and projected to reach $2.25 trillion by 2030. With a compound annual growth
                    rate (“CAGR ”) ranging from 33.2% to 38.1%, AI's global impact is undeniable,
                    with as many as 97 million individuals expected to work in the AI sector by
                    2025, according to fortunebusinessinsights.com.The global CBD market is
                    positioned for exponential growth, and e-commerce is at the heart of this
                    expansion. By tailoring our chat bots to serve this niche, we believe we are
                    well-poised to capitalize on this extraordinary growth trajectory. Our chatbots
                    will empower both our shareholders and business partners to thrive in an
                    ever-expanding market. The global CBD market size was valued at $6.4 billion in
                    2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.2%
                    from 2023 to 2030.We plan to contract with retailers and brands using a monthly
                    licensing model. Our licensing model is designed with businesses in mind. It
                    allows companies, particularly those in the CBD industry, to integrate our
                    chatbots into their platforms seamlessly. This approach not only reduces the
                    development burden on businesses but also expedites the deployment of AI-driven
                    solutions, enhancing customer experiences without requiring extensive
                    resources.  </company_designated_header>
                <company_designated_header title="Products"
                    parsing_type="strong;emphasis;emphasis capitalization;">We develop AI chatbot’s
                    that are specifically designed to the industry and products for a retailer or
                    brands. The bot is trained on industry specific questions and answers to give
                    the most accurate information to costumers’ inquiries in a conversational and
                    natural style. The bot is also uploaded with the ability to recommend products
                    by using the conversation and costumers input to drive to a tailed product
                    recommendation. The chatbot is tailored to the CBD industry currently but can be
                    programmed to accommodate any consumer facing industry.____________________<company_designated_header

                    rules promulgated by the SEC. Under these rules, broker-dealers participating in
                    transactions in these securities must first deliver a risk disclosure document
                    which describes risks associated with these stocks, broker-dealers’ duties,
                    customers’ rights and remedies, market and other information, and make
                    suitability determinations approving the customers for these stock transactions
                    based on financial situation, investment experience and objectives.
                    Broker-dealers must also disclose these restrictions in writing, provide monthly
                    account statements to customers, and obtain specific written consent of each
                    customer. With these restrictions, the likely effect of designation as a penny
                    stock is to decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to make a market for the
                    stock, to decrease the liquidity of the stock and increase the transaction cost

                2021. Management believes the assumptions made to carve out the Company’s underlying
                standalone financial statements from the consolidated Singlepoint results prior to
                the April 2021 spin-off are reasonable. Nevertheless, the financial statements may
                not include all the actual expenses that would have been incurred had the Company
                operated as a standalone company during the period prior to the spin-off. Actual
                costs that would have been incurred if the Company had operated as a standalone
                company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and
                strategic decisions made in various areas.In August 2023, we achieved our goal of
                creating a chatbot using AI technology to be placed on CBD retailers’ and brands’
                websites. This chatbot is able to answer questions specifically tailored to the CBD
                industry and can be trained on client specific questions as well as trained to
                accommodate other industries. In addition to the ability to answer questions, the
                bot can use answers and customer feedback to recommend a product from the list
                uploaded by the client. On August 17, 2023, we engaged AR XTLabs to help in
                development of an AI chatbot specifically designed for the CBD industry. The chatbot
                offers CBD and wellness merchants the ability to increase sales by providing product
                recommendations, track user behavior for inventory management, and ChatCBDW can also
                provide information on products and education around the clock. Our bot was built on
                Microsoft Azure by AR XTLabs, a state-of-the-art development company in the AI
                space. ChatCBDW is a proprietary bot fully integrated with ChatGPT, a
                state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI. This integration equips
                ChatCBDW with natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning capabilities,
                allowing lifelike conversations and intelligent product recommendations. It's
                designed to drive sales, educate audiences on products, and provide analytics on
                customer preferences and behavior, contributing to inventory management. The chat
                technology is enhanced through a patent possible process that tailors product
                recommendations to merchant specifications.In September 2023, we partnered with Cool
                Blue Distribution, a leading CBD distributor, to better expand our CBD expertise and
                gain access hundreds of retailers and brands. The Company agreed to install the bot
                on Cool Blue’s website as the first beta tester of our new chatbot.   On October 31,
                2023, we announced that the beta version of our ChatCBDW bot was live on our site as

                the Company has yet to achieve profitable operations, and while the Company hopes to
                achieve profitable operations in the future, if not it may need to raise capital
                from stockholders or other sources to sustain operations and to ultimately achieve
                viable operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability
                to continue as a going concern. The Company’s principal sources of liquidity have
                been cash provided by operating activities, as well as its ability to raise capital.
                The Company’s operating results for future periods are subject to numerous
                uncertainties and it is uncertain if the Company will be able to become profitable
                and continue growth for the foreseeable future. If management is not able to
                increase revenue and/or manage operating expenses, the Company may not be able to
                achieve profitability. The Company’s ability to continue in existence is dependent
                on the Company’s ability to achieve profitable operations.To continue operations for
                the next 12 months, we will have a cash need of approximately $1,000,000. Should we
                not be able to fulfill our cash needs through the increase of revenue, we will need
                to raise money through outside investors through convertible notes, debt or similar
                instrument(s). The Company plans to pay off current liabilities through sales and
                increasing revenue through sales of Company services and or products, or through
                financing activities as mentioned above, although there is no guarantee that the
                Company will ultimately do so.<company_designated_header

                    parsing_type="strong;emphasis;emphasis capitalization;">The preparation of
                financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
                the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
                that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
                contingent assets and liabilities of the date of the financial statements and the
                reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Notes to the
                Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used
                in the preparation of the Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not
                limited to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ materially from
                those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted
                significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of
                    the Financial Statements.</company_designated_header><company_designated_header

                    to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. The
                Company considers the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence
                of a liability, as well as its ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in
                determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when
                management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired, or a
                liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
                The Company regularly evaluates current information available to us to determine
                whether such accruals should be adjusted.</company_designated_header><company_designated_header

                    parsing_type="strong;emphasis;emphasis capitalization;">We have established
                    disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
                    required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is
                    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
                    in the rules and forms of the SEC and, as such, is accumulated and communicated
                    to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Gregory Lambrecht,
                    who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
                    as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Mr.
                    Lambrecht evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures,
                    as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2023. Based
                    on his evaluation, Mr. Lambrecht concluded that, due to a material weakness in
                    our internal control over financial reporting as described below, our disclosure
                    controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2023. In light of
                    the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, we completed
                    substantive procedures, including validating the completeness and accuracy of
                    the underlying data used for accounting prior to filing this Annual Report.These
                    additional procedures have allowed us to conclude that, notwithstanding the
                    material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the
                    financial statements included in this Annual Report fairly present, in all
                    material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows

                    accepted in the United States of America.<company_designated_header

                        parsing_type="strong;emphasis;">Our management is responsible for
                    establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting
                    for the Company. Due to limited resources, management conducted an evaluation of
                    internal controls based on criteria established in 2013 Internal Control -
                    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
                    Treadway Commission (“COSO ”). The results of this evaluation determined that
                        our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December
                    31,
                        2023, due to material weaknesses. A material weakness in internal control
                    over
                        financial reporting is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of
                    deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
                    reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim
                    financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A
                    significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in
                    internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material
                    weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for
                    oversight of our financial reporting.Management’s assessment identified the
                    following material weaknesses in internal control over financial
                        reporting:1.lack of a functioning audit committee for the entire fiscal year
                    resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of
                    required internal control and procedures; and2.inadequate segregation of duties
                    consistent with control objectives.We will continue to follow the standards for
                    the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) for internal
                    control over financial reporting to include procedures that: ·Pertain to the
                    maintenance of records in reasonable detail accurately that fairly reflect the
                    transactions and dispositions of our assets;    ·Provide reasonable assurance
                    that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the
                    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
                        principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in
                    accordance
                        with authorizations of management and the Board of Directors;
                    and    ·Provide
                        reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
                    unauthorized
                        acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material
                    effect
                        on the financial statements.Despite the material weaknesses in financial
                    reporting noted above, we believe that our financial statements included in this
                    report fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash

                    parsing_type="strong;emphasis;emphasis capitalization;">On May 10, 2021, the
                Company entered into an employment agreement with Greg Lambrecht (Director, CEO, and
                CFO of the Company) to serve as Chief Operating Officer of the Company at an annual
                salary of $250,000. The agreement provides for a term of three years and will
                automatically be renewed for additional six month periods unless either party has
                provided written termination of the agreement at least 90 days prior to the
                expiration of such term. If employment is terminated as a result of death or
                Disability, the Company shall pay to the base salary and any accrued but unpaid
                    bonus and expense reimbursement amounts through the date of his death or
                disability
                    and a lump sum payment equal to one year of base salary (at the time his death
                or
                    disability occurs) within 30 days of his death or disability. In the event the
                Company does not have the cash flow to pay such amount within 30 days as set forth
                above, the Company may make such payments over 12 equal monthly installments. If
                employment is terminated by the Board of Directors of the Company for Cause (as
                defined in the agreement), then the Company shall pay to the base salary through the
                date of his termination and shall have no further obligation to any other
                compensation or benefits. If employment is terminated by the Company (or its
                successor) upon the occurrence of a change of control or within six (6) months
                thereafter, the Company (or its successor, as applicable) shall (i) continue to pay
                to the base salary for a period of twelve (12) months following such termination,
                (ii) pay the any accrued and any earned but unpaid bonus, (iii) pay the bonus he
                would have earned had he remained with the Company for six (6) months from the date
                which such termination occurs, and (iv) pay expense reimbursement amounts through
                    the date of termination. If employment is terminated by Mr. Lambrecht for Good
                Reason, or by the Company without Cause, then the Company shall (i) pay a single
                    lump sum cash payment within five business days of such termination equal to six
                (6)
                    times the then monthly base salary in effect regardless of when such termination
                occurs (provided, that in the event the Company does not have the cash flow to pay
                such amount within five business days as set forth above, the Company may make such
                payments over 12 equal monthly installments), and (ii) pay the bonus Mr. Lambrecht
                would have earned had he remained with the Company for six (6) months from the date
                which such termination occurs, and (iii) pay any expense reimbursement amounts owed,
                and payment for any unused vacation days, through the date of termination. Effective
                February 28, 2024, we entered into a new Employment Agreement with Mr. Lambrecht.
                    The term of the agreement is three years from the effective date, and will renew
                for
                    six month periods automatically unless terminated by either party providing 90
                days
                    of prior written notice or for “Cause,” as defined in the agreement. Pursuant to
                the
                    agreement, Mr. Lambrecht is entitled to an annual salary of $250,000. Mr.
                Lambrecht
                    is also entitled to a bonus as determined by our Board of Directors, healthcare
                (once established by the Company), reimbursement of expenses, and 20 vacation days
                per year. Also, as an inducement to enter into the agreement, Mr. Lambrecht was
                awarded 60 shares of Series B Super Voting Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred

                    parsing_type="strong;emphasis;emphasis capitalization;">The Board believes that
                the most effective executive compensation program is one that is designed to reward
                the achievement of specific annual, long-term and strategic goals by the Company and
                that aligns executives’ interests with those of the stockholders by rewarding
                performance above established goals, with the ultimate objective of improving
                stockholder value. As a result of the size of the Company, the Board evaluates both
                performance and compensation on an informal basis. Upon hiring additional
                    executives, the Board intends to establish a Compensation Committee to evaluate
                both
                    performance and compensation to ensure that the Company maintains its ability to
                attract and retain superior employees in key positions and that compensation
                    provided to key employees remains competitive.</company_designated_header></item>

                beneficially own more than 5% of any class of our outstanding stock.Except as
                indicated by the footnotes below, we believe, based on information furnished to us,
                that the persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting and sole
                investment power with respect to all shares of common stock that they beneficially
                owned, subject to applicable community property laws. Unless otherwise specified the

                85016.Our calculation of the percentage of beneficial ownership prior to this
                offering is based on 62,486,877 shares of common stock outstanding as of April 15,
                2024, we also have 56,322,598 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 90 shares of
                Series B Preferred Stock outstanding. We have determined beneficial ownership in
                accordance with the rules of the SEC, and the information is not necessarily
                indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Under Rule 13d-3 of the
                Exchange, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or
                indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or
                otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote or to
                direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to
                dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be
                beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power
                to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be
                beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares
                (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the
                information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person or
                persons, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares
                beneficially owned by such person or persons (and only such person or persons) by
                reason of these acquisition rights.Name  Shares of Common Stock   Percentage of

                    parsing_type="strong;emphasis;emphasis capitalization;">We have audited the
            accompanying balance sheets of 1606 Corp. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and
            2022, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit and parent’s net
            investment, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31,
            2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In
            our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
            financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of
            its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December
            31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
            States of America.</company_designated_header><company_designated_header

            accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will
            continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the
            entity has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency
            that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
            Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The
            financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
            of this uncertainty.<company_designated_header title="Basis for Opinion"
                        parsing_type="emphasis;emphasis capitalization;">These financial statements
            are the responsibility of the entity’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
            opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting
            firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
            ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
            with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
            Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance
            with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
            audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
            material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to
            have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
            reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
            control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
            effectiveness of the entity's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we
            express no such opinion.Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of
            material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
            performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining,
            on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
            statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
            significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
            of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
            our opinion.<company_designated_header title="/s/ Turner, Stone &amp; Company, L.L.P."

            consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of
            assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rates. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a
            valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
            deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
            adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates.Tax benefits are recognized
            from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position
            will be sustained upon examination by a tax authority and based upon the technical

            requires that certain financial instruments be recognized at their fair values at our
            balance sheet dates. However, other financial instruments, such as debt obligations, are
            not required to be recognized at their fair values, but GAAP provides an option to elect
            fair value accounting for these instruments. GAAP requires the disclosure of the fair
            values of all financial instruments, regardless of whether they are recognized at their
            fair values or carrying amounts in our balance sheets. For financial instruments
            recognized at fair value, GAAP requires the disclosure of their fair values by type of
            instrument, along with other information, including changes in the fair values of
                        certain financial instruments recognized in income or other comprehensive
            income. For
                        financial instruments not recognized at fair value, the disclosure of their
            fair values

            property,

            carrying
                        amounts in the Company’s balance sheets. GAAP does not permit nonfinancial
            assets and
                        liabilities to be remeasured at their fair values. However, GAAP requires
            the
                        remeasurement of such assets and liabilities to their fair values upon the
            occurrence of

            addition, if
