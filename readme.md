# SEC Parsers
Parses non-standardized SEC 10-K filings into well structured detailed xml. Use cases include LLMs, NLP, and textual analysis. 

TODO:
* reduce number of variables and rename for detectors
* add dynamic handling of xml construction based on object
* reduce error rate back to normal levels (less than 1 pct)
* Add more supported filings: S1 first
* add warnings for set headers and automatic type detection

GitHub TODO
* Readme readability revamp
* file supported
* speed - less than a second avg, code not optimized, will be reduced
* how to install
* quickstart
* export to csv, xml etc
* how to define custom parsers
* Links github dropbox
* Problem clearly stated
* How SEC Parsers works
* Roadmap
* statistics

Future:
* image OCR / hosting (FAR)
* visualizer rewrite - e.g. pdf viewer but for headers
* table handling (I think can probably get to 95% table handling relatively easily)

Package Roadmap
* Stage 1: Support a lot of filing types with >99% parse rate, and very detailed trees without errors
* Stage 2: cluster headers e.g. season seasonal variation
* Stage 3: LLMS + OCR on filings, e.g. to see if section just says nothing here, or e.g. to describe image
* Stage 4: backwards compatability for text files

How people can help:
* Better color scheme suggestion for visualizer
* Hosting for parsed files (future)
* suggestions for better RAG for LLMS
* suggestions for other metadata
* qol improvements, e.g. for finding titles etc within parsed xml


Feature request:
* save_dta - save xml to dta. similar to csv function

Issues
1. handle if PART I appears multiple times as header, e.g. logic here item 1 continued.

Better format below, and add more:

* [sec-api](https://sec-api.io/). Paid API to search / download SEC filings. Basically, SEC's EDGAR but setup in a much nicer format. I haven't used it since it costs money.
